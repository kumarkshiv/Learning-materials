Q) Slice in C++:

  - In C++, "slice" (i..e, object slicing) is a concept that happens when a **derived class (child class)** object is assigned to a **base class (parent)** object by value. The extra parts of the derived class get cut off (sliced) and only the base part is kept.
  - Simple Explanation (Imagine a Pizza Slice):
    - A Derived class is like a big pizza with extra toppings.
    - A Base class is like a small plain pizza.
    - If you try to put the big pizza into the small pizza box:
      - The extra toppings get cut off (sliced).
      - That is **object slicing.**
